# GreenScore by the Bug Busters.
This website is created with the intention of encouraging environmentally friendly behavior such as reducing the use of non-reusable materials, recycling, and increasing the level of use of eco-friendly materials. The website includes a vast range of features, such as hover-flashcards, quizzes, real-time statistics, and many others which are tested to spread climate change awareness in an interactive and gamified way.

We learnt specialized concepts of Web Development for the first time, in various languages including CSS, JavaScript and HTML. We used different visually appealling ideas, including Parallax (visuals move in response to scroll's movement). 

This is the best project we have made yet.
